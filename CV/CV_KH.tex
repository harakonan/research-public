% \section{Dissertation}
% \cvitem{Title}{\emph{Claims-based algorithms for common chronic conditions were investigated using regularly collected data in Japan}}
% \cvitem{Supervisor}{Yasuki Kobayashi}
% \cvitem{Description}{The literature of claims-based algorithm (CBA) has two features to be refined: the use of a chart review as a source of the gold standard; the procedure of searching for a fine-tuned CBA based on existing knowledge regarding target conditions. The first feature limits the population to which the CBA can be applied and the second makes the CBA construction procedure to be an overly complicated and cumbersome matter. Moreover, the burden of reviewing charts and searching for a fine-tuned CBA lead to a slow establishment of acceptable CBAs because it discourages researchers from CBA studies. The sluggish establishment of usable CBAs can be a big issue as the codes recorded in the claims for transmitting information about patients are supposed to change periodically. The dissertation focused on CBAs for identifying patients with three common chronic medical conditions, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and (1) demonstrated the usefulness of health screening results as the source of gold standard; (2) showed the power of statistical learning methods to develop an efficient CBA construction procedure; (3) proposed a course of action for an efficient CBA research. I believe that the series of techniques evaluated in the study should become essential in future CBA research.}
