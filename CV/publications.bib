abstract = {Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has a natural history of bidirectional transition between different states. Therefore, conventional statistical models assuming a unidirectional disease progression may oversimplify CIN fate. We applied a continuous-time multistate Markov model to predict this CIN fate by addressing the probability of transitions between multiple states according to the genotypes of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). This retrospective cohort comprised 6022 observations in 737 patients (195 normal, 259 CIN1, and 283 CIN2 patients at the time of entry in the cohort). Patients were followed up or treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2008 and 2015. Our model captured the prevalence trend satisfactory, particularly for up to two years. The estimated probabilities for 2-year transition to CIN3 or more were the highest in HPV 16-positive patients (13{\%}, 30{\%}, and 42{\%} from normal, CIN1, and CIN2, respectively) compared with those in the other genotype-positive patients (3.1–9.6{\%}, 7.6–16{\%}, and 21–32{\%} from normal, CIN1, and CIN2, respectively). Approximately 40{\%} of HPV 52- or 58-related CINs remained at CIN1 and CIN2. The Markov model highlights the differences in transition and progression patterns between high-risk HPV-related CINs. HPV genotype-based management may be desirable for patients with cervical lesions.},

abstract = {Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major complication in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The utility of CMV prophylaxis with letermovir has been reported; however, the specific applications remain unclear. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed large-scale registry data (N = 10 480) to clarify the risk factors for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in connection with CMV reactivation. First, we identified risk factors for CMV reactivation using multivariate analysis and developed a scoring model. Although the model effectively stratified reactivation risk into 3 groups (43.7{\%} vs 60.9{\%} vs 71.5{\%}; P {\textless} .001), the 3-year NRM was significantly higher in patients with CMV reactivation, even in the low (20.9{\%} vs 13.0{\%}, P {\textless} .001), intermediate (21.4{\%} vs 15.6{\%}; P {\textless} .001), and high (29.3{\%} vs 18.0{\%}; P {\textless} .001) reactivation risk groups. Next, survival analysis considering competing risks, time-dependent covariates, and interaction terms for exploring the heterogeneous impact of CMV reactivation on NRM in the training cohort revealed that chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.96; P = .033), good performance status (PS) (HR, 1.42; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.94; P = .028), HLA-matched donor (HR, 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.70; P = .013), and standard-risk disease (HR, 1.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.58; P = .022) were associated with increased NRM. In the test cohort, CMV reactivation was significantly associated with increased 3-year NRM among patients with 2 to 4 factors (22.1{\%} vs 13.1{\%}; P {\textless} .001) but was comparable among patients with 0 or 1 factor (23.2{\%} vs 20.4{\%}; P = .62). We propose that CMV prophylaxis should be determined based on reactivation risk, as well as these other factors.},

abstract = {Background: The role and impact of radiation therapy (RT) on the development of herpes zoster (HZ) has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between RT and HZ. Methods: A propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted using institutional cancer registry data and medical records from 2011 to 2015. The risk of developing HZ in the RT and non-RT groups was compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. Associations also were explored between the RT field and the anatomic location of HZ in patients who developed HZ after RT. The expected number of HZ events within the radiation field was calculated according to the RT received by each patient; then, this number was compared with the observed number of in-field events. Results: Of 17,655 patients, propensity score matching yielded 4350 pairs; of these, 3891 pairs were eligible for comparison. The cumulative incidence of HZ in the RT group (vs the non-RT group) during the first 5 years after the index date was 2.1{\%} (vs 0.7{\%}) at 1 year, 3.0{\%} (vs 1.0{\%}) at 2 years, 3.4{\%} (vs 1.3{\%}) at 3 years, 4.1{\%} vs 1.7{\%} at 4 years, and 4.4{\%} vs 1.8{\%} at 5 years. The RT group showed a significantly higher risk of HZ than the non-RT group (hazard ratio, 2.59, 95{\%} CI, 1.84-3.66). In the 120 patients who developed HZ after RT, HZ events were observed significantly more frequently within the RT field than expected (74 vs 43.8 events; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions: Patients with cancer who received RT showed a significantly higher risk of HZ, which was commonly observed within the radiation field.},

abstract = {We retrospectively compared the post-transplantation graft survival and the donor's estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) following living donor kidney transplantations (LDKTs) involving medically complex living donors (MCLDs) (the elderly and patients with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or reduced renal function) and standard living donors (SLDs). The clinical data on patients who underwent LDKTs at our institution from 2006–2019, including 192 SLDs and 99 MCLDs, were evaluated. Regarding recipients, the log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses showed a higher incidence of overall and death-censored graft loss in the recipients who received kidneys from MCLDs (Hazard ratio = 2.16 and 3.25, P = 0.015 and 0.004, respectively), after adjusting for recipient-related variables including age, sex, duration of dialysis, ABO compatibility, and donor-specific antibody positivity. Regarding donors, a linear mixed model showed significantly lower postdonation eGFRs (−2.25 ml/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.048) at baseline in MCLDs than SLDs, but comparable change (difference = 0.01 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, P = 0.97). In conclusion, although kidneys from MCLDs are associated with impaired graft survival, the donation did not adversely affect the MCLDs' renal health in at least the short-term. LDKTs involving carefully selected MCLDs would be an acceptable alternative for recipients with no SLDs.},

abstract = {Background: Radiotherapy (RT) is effective in cervical cancer; radiation-induced lymphopenia correlates with poor survival outcome in several cancer types. We investigated the association of total lymphocyte count (TLC) with survival outcomes in patients with cervical cancer. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 168 patients with cervical cancer initially treated with definitive RT. We obtained clinicopathological data and TLCs before RT and at the end and at 6 months after RT. Patient-, treatment-, and tumor-specific factors were evaluated to determine their predictive values for overall survival. The association of overall and progression-free survivals with lymphopenia at each point was evaluated. Results: Median follow-up duration was 44 (interquartile range: 25–67) months. Median TLCs before RT and at the end and at 6 months after RT were 1625/mm3, 400/mm3, and 800/mm3 (interquartile range: 1270–1930/mm3, 290–550/mm3, and 600–1067/mm3), respectively. For overall survival, in addition to FIGO stage, body mass index, histology, treatment, and presence of para-aortic lymph node metastasis, lymphopenia at 6 months after RT was a poor prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.0026; hazard ratio [HR], 3.06; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.48–6.33). For progression-free survival, TLCs before and at 6 months after RT were poor prognostic factors in univariate analysis (P = 0.0318 and 0.0081, respectively); however, the latter was the only independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.0021; HR, 2.67; 95{\%} CI: 1.43–4.99). Conclusion: Post-RT persistent lymphopenia could be a poor prognostic factor for patients with cervical cancer who receive RT.},

abstract = {Aim: Emergency department information systems (EDIS) facilitate free-text data use for clinical research; however, no study has validated whether the Next Stage ER system (NSER), an EDIS used in Japan, accurately translates electronic medical records (EMRs) into structured data. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care hospital from 2018 to 2019. We used EMRs of 500 random samples from 27,000 ED visits during the study period. Through the NSER system, chief complaints were translated into 231 chief complaint categories based on the Japan Triage and Acuity Scale. Medical history and physi-cian's diagnoses were encoded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; medications were encoded as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. Two reviewers independently reviewed 20 items (e.g., presence of fever) for each study component (e.g., chief complaints). We calculated association measures of the structured data by the NSER system, using the chart review results as the gold standard. Results: Sensitivities were very high ({\textgreater}90{\%}) in 17 chief complaints. Positive predictive values were high for 14 chief complaints (≥80{\%}). Negative predictive values were ≥96{\%} for all chief complaints. For medical history and medications, most of the association measures were very high ({\textgreater}90{\%}). For physicians' ED diagnoses, sensitivities were very high ({\textgreater}93{\%}) in 16 diagnoses; specificities and negative predictive values were very high ({\textgreater}97{\%}). Conclusions: Chief complaints, medical history, medications, and physician's ED diagnoses in EMRs were well-translated into existing categories or coding by the NSER system.},

abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a primary cause of cervical cancer. Although epidemiologic study revealed that carcinogenic risk differs according to HPV genotypes, the expression patterns of HPV-derived transcripts and their dependence on HPV genotypes have not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: In this study, 382 patients with abnormal cervical cytology were enrolled to assess the associations between HPV-derived transcripts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades and/or HPV genotypes. Specifically, four HPV-derived transcripts, namely, oncogenes E6 and E6*, E1{\^{}}E4, and viral capsid protein L1 in four major HPV genotypes—HPV 16, 18, 52, and 58—were investigated. Results: The detection rate of E6/E6* increased with CIN progression, whereas there was no significant change in the detection rate of E1{\^{}}E4 or L1 among CIN grades. In addition, we found that L1 gene expression was HPV type-dependent. Almost all HPV 52-positive specimens, approximately 50{\%} of HPV 58-positive specimens, around 33{\%} of HPV 16-positive specimens, and only one HPV18-positive specimen expressed L1. Conclusions: We demonstrated that HPV-derived transcripts are HPV genotype-dependent. Especially, expression patterns of L1 gene expression might reflect HPV genotype-dependent patterns of carcinogenesis.},
